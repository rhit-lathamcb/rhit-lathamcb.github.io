        <h2>Guitar Hero on FPGA Board</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Date: </strong>Mar-May 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Description: </strong>Programmed a Guitar Hero knockoff on an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) board using Quartus Prime and ModelSim. Below is a video showcasing a similar project, as I do not have any video footage of my own; in my version of the project, the game was entirely played on the FPGA board using the two pairs of numbers to the left of the score display to represent the notes.</li>
